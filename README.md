# Setup rclone backups

1. Go to `https://SERVER_URL/backup/backupDestinations` add local path as `/home/backup`

2. Go to `https://SERVER_URL/backup/scheduleBackup` and select destination as `backup`

3. Add backup frequency (daily, weekly) and backup retention (0 = unlimited)

4. A cronjob will run every day to copy these backups to remote backup 

You can [drop in a sql backup script](https://github.com/josephgodwinkimani/cyberpanel-mods/blob/main/rclone_sqlbackup_cronjob.sh), edit it and add it to `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root` to run once everyday to backup all your databases to a remote location(s).
